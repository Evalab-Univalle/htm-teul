# HTM-TEUL

## Description
HTM-TEUL is an experiment to evaluate the use of the HTM theory on Natural 
Language Processing. TEUL stands for Task Execution Using Language. The
software allows you to give sentences in spanish or english in order to
execute a task in a virtual, controlled environment. You can find the data
used to train the learning system in Learning/Data.

I presented this project as my undergraduate "thesis". You may find the full text (in spanish) in my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305114878_Desarrollo_de_un_modelo_HTM_para_la_ejecucion_de_tareas_utilizando_el_lenguaje_natural?ev=prf_pub).
